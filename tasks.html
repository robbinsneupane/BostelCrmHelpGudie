      <h1>Tasks</h1>
      <p>
        BostelCRM can enhance Users' productivity by providing a means to
        document, associate, and delegate Tasks and action items. To access the
        Tasks module, click on the Module List menu in the top navigation bar or
        select the Tasks button on the Bottom Navigation menu.
      </p>
      <h2>Tasks Actions</h2>
      <div class="actions">
        <img src="/Assets/tasks.png" alt="" />
        <img src="/Assets/tasks2.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Depending on the screen or device size, you can access the Tasks
          actions either from the Tasks module menu dropdown or via the Sidebar.
        </p>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Create Task</p>
          <p>
            To create a new Task record, you can open a new form in Edit View.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">View Tasks</p>
          <p>
            By clicking on it, you will be redirected to the List View for the
            Tasks module, which enables you to search and display Task records.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Managing Taks</h2>
      <img src="/Assets/managingTasks.png" alt="" />
      <ul>
        <li>
          To sort Task records in the List View, simply click on any column
          title that is sortable, and the records will be sorted in either
          ascending or descending order accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you need to search for a specific task, refer to the Search section
          of this user guide.
        </li>
        <li>
          To access the details of a task, click on its subject in the List
          View. This will open the task record in Detail View.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you want to edit a task's details, you have two options: in Detail
          View, click Edit on the Actions menu, or click the pencil/edit button
          in List View, make the necessary changes, and click Save.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you need to create a duplicate of a task, go to Detail View and
          click Duplicate on the Actions menu. Then make the desired
          modifications to the new record and save it.
        </li>
        <li>
          To mark a task as completed, open its detail view and click Close on
          the Actions menu. This will change the task status to Completed.
          Alternatively, you can click Close and Create New to close the current
          task and create a new one with the same subject in Edit View.
        </li>
        <li>
          To remove a task from the list, open its Detail View and select Delete
          from the Actions menu.
