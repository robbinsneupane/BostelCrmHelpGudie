      <h1>Leads</h1>
      <p>
        BostelCRM defines a Lead as an unqualified contact that often results
        from a marketing-related event. For instance, it could be someone who
        completed a form on your website or someone you met at a trade show, but
        whose buying authority is yet to be determined. Once a Lead is qualified
        and converted, it can be separated into two parts: a Contact, once you
        have identified "Who" the person is, and an Opportunity, once you know
        "What" they might buy. You can find the Leads module either by selecting
        it from the Module List menu in the top navigation or by clicking the
        Leads button in the Bottom Navigation menu.
      </p>
      <h2>Leads Actions</h2>

        <img src="/Assets/Images/leads2.webp" alt="" />
        <p>
          The Leads module menu drop-down or Sidebar, depending on your screen
          or device size, provides access to the various actions related to
          Leads. These actions are:
        </p>
      </div>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Create Lead</p>
          <p>
            To create a new Account record, an Edit View opens up with a new
            form.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Create Lead from vCard</p>
          <p>
            You will be redirected to the Import Wizard for the Leads module.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">View Leads</p>
          <p>
            You will be redirected to the List View of the Leads module, where
            you can search for and view a list of Lead records.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Create Leads</h2>
      <img src="/Assets/Images/createLeads.webp" alt="" />
      <p>
        Creating Leads is a simple process, and the data fields should be
        self-explanatory. The procedure is quite similar to creating a contact,
        with the addition of a few extra fields for the lead's status and
        source.
      </p>
      <h2>Create Leads from vCard</h2>
      <img src="/Assets/Images/vCard.webp" alt="" />
      <p>
        To create a lead from a vCard, first, select "Create Lead From vCard"
        from the list of actions for leads. This will redirect you to the Import
        vCard page. Once there, click on the "Choose File" button, which will
        open your system's file browser, allowing you to locate and select the
        desired .vcf vCard format file. After you have chosen the file, click
        the "Import vCard" button, and BostelCRM will create the lead using the
        data obtained from the vCard.
      </p>
      <h2>Managing Leads</h2>
      <img src="/Assets/Images/managingLeads.webp" alt="" />
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          Clicking on any sortable column title in the Leads List View will sort
          the records in either ascending or descending order.
        </li>
        <li>
          For information on how to search for a Lead, please refer to the
          Search section of this user guide.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clicking on the Lead Name in the List View will open the record in
          Detail View, allowing you to view its details.
        </li>
        <li>
          To make changes to the Lead details, click the Edit button in the
          Actions menu within the Detail View or the pencil/edit button in the
          List View, make the necessary modifications, and then click Save.
        </li>
        <li>
          To create a duplicate Lead, click on the Duplicate button in the
          Actions menu within the Detail View, edit the duplicate record, and
          then save it.
        </li>
        <li>
          To delete a Lead record, go to the Detail View of that lead and select
          Delete from the Actions menu.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Converting a Lead</h2>
      <div class="flex img">
        <p>
          When sufficient information is obtained about a Lead, it can be
          advanced to the next Sales stage and converted into a Contact or
          Opportunity. To initiate the conversion process, open the Detail View
          of an individual Lead by clicking on its record. Then, click the arrow
          located next to the Actions button and select 'Convert Lead' from the
          drop-down menu as shown in the image:
        </p>
        <img src="/Assets/Images/convertLead.webp" alt="" />
      </div>
      <p>
        After clicking the 'Convert Lead' button, you will be directed to the
        Convert Lead page.
      </p>
      <h2>Converting a Lead to a Contact</h2>
      <p>
        This page allows you to either create a new contact or select an
        existing one.
      </p>
      <img src="/Assets/Images/leadToContact.webp" alt="" />
      <p>
        If you uncheck the checkbox next to 'Create Contact', you can associate
        the Lead with an existing Contact. However, in most cases, there won't
        be an existing Contact to associate with, so you should make sure to
        select the Create Contact checkbox. Certain fields will automatically be
        filled in with information from the Lead. Complete the remaining
        relevant fields and move on to the next stage below to convert the Lead
        into an Opportunity.
      </p>
      <h2>Convert a Lead to Opportunity</h2>
      <img src="/Assets/Images/leadToOpportunity.webp" alt="" />

      <h2>Other Lead Conversion Options</h2>
      <div class="flex">
        <img src="/Assets/Images/otherLead.webp" alt="" />
        <p>
          In a similar manner as Contacts and Opportunities, you can create
          other records when converting a Lead. <br /><br />
          Once you have finished filling out the necessary fields, click on the
          'Save' button to save and confirm the changes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Duplicate Record Check</h2>
