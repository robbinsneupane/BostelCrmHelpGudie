      <h1>Meetings</h1>
      <p>
        The Meetings module in BostelCRM, similar to the Calls module, enables
        Users to create Meeting records for any Meetings they have participated
        in. With the Meeting scheduler, Users can invite attendees, send email
        invitations, set reminders, reschedule meetings, and link them to other
        modules such as Contacts, Tasks, Opportunities, and more. This module
        offers additional useful features that aid Users in planning and
        managing their Meetings. Access the Meetings module by selecting it from
        the Module List menu on the top navigation menu or by using the Meetings
        button on the Bottom Navigation menu.
      </p>
      <h2>Meetings Actions</h2>
      <div class="actions">
        <img src="/Assets/meeting.png" alt="" />
        <img src="/Assets/meeting2.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          The Meetings actions can be accessed from either the Meetings module
          menu dropdown or the Sidebar and include:
        </p>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Schedule Meetings</p>
          <p>
            Upon selecting the Edit View, a new form will appear, enabling you
            to create a new Meeting record.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">View Meetings</p>
          <p>
            You will be directed to the List View of the Meetings module, which
            enables you to search for and list Meeting records.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Managing Meetings</h2>
      <img src="/Assets/manageMeetings.png" alt="" />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Click on any sortable column title in the Meetings List View to sort
          records in ascending or descending order.
        </li>
        <li>
          Refer to the Search section of the user guide to search for a specific
          Meeting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click on the Meeting Subject in the List View to access the details of
          a specific Meeting in the Detail View.
        </li>
        <li>
          To duplicate a Meeting, select the Duplicate button in the Detail
          View, and then save the duplicated record.
        </li>
        <li>
          To close a Meeting, select the 'x' icon in the Meetings List View or
          use the Close button on the Detail View of a Meeting. Alternatively,
          use the Close and Create New button, which will close the current
          Meeting and redirect you to the Edit View to create a new record.
        </li>
        <li>
          To Reschedule a Meeting, edit the Start Date &amp; Time field. One
          practical method is to double-click on it to inline-edit it directly
          from the Detail View of a Meeting.
        </li>
        <li>
          To delete a Meeting, navigate to the Detail View and select the Delete
          button in the Actions tab.
        </li>
        <li>
          To modify Meeting details, use the Edit icon in the List View or
          select the Edit button in the Detail View's Actions tab, make the
          necessary changes, and then click Save.
        </li>
      </ul>
