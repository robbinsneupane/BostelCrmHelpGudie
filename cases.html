      <h1>Cases</h1>
      <p>
        BostelCRM utilizes Cases to document customer interactions where they
        seek assistance or guidance, typically in sales or support functions.
        Users can create, update, assign, and close Cases as they work on them,
        while tracking incoming and outgoing communication threads at each
        stage. This ensures a comprehensive record of the Case's progress is
        maintained within the CRM. Additionally, Cases can be associated with
        specific records, such as Contacts.
