      <h1>Notes</h1>
      <p>
        BostelCRM's Notes module is designed to enable Users to maintain an
        internal record of their organization's comments, observations, or
        explanations. Additionally, Users can use Notes to keep track of
        interactions with Customers about Cases, or to document information
        related to other BostelCRM records like Contacts, Leads, and more.
      </p>
