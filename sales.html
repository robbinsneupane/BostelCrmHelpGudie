      <h1>Sales</h1>
      <p>
        The sales modules includes several modules that enable you to handle the
        sales processes that occur after an opportunity has been identified.
        These modules allow you to manage activities such as generating quotes
        and creating invoices. The following modules provide this functionality:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="listName">Product Categories</li>
        <li class="listName">Products</li>
        <li class="listName">PDF Templates</li>
        <li class="listName">Quotations</li>
        <li class="listName">Invoices</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Product Module</h2>
      <p>
        In order to enable users to choose product lines while creating quotes
        and invoices, the Products module can be used to create Product records.
        The Products module allows users to specify various details about the
        product such as its name, part number, category, type, and more.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to specifying product details, the Products module also
        enables users to set a cost and selling price for the product. The
        selling price will be utilized during the quoting process. Users can
        also associate a related contact with the product, which represents the
        supplier's point of contact for that particular product. Additionally,
        users can upload an image of the product and specify a URL to the
        product page on their website.
      </p>
      <h2>Product Categories Module</h2>
      <p>
        With the Product Categories module, users can organize products into a
        hierarchical structure based on categories. To create a Product Category
        record, users can access the Product Categories module located under
        Settings in the User menu and click either the 'Create Product
        Categories' button in the action bar or the "ADD" button at the bottom.
      </p>
      <img src="/Assets/productCategories.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        The Parent Category field in the Product Categories module is a
        relationship field that links to another Product Categories record. When
        the 'Is Parent Category' field is selected, it indicates that the
        category is the highest level in the hierarchy. If a category is marked
        as a parent category, users will not be able to select another parent
        category using the related field.
      </p>

      <h2>PDF Templates</h2>
      <h3>Create PDF Template</h3>
      <p>
        Generating PDF documents from various modules is possible in BostelCRM.
        However, prior to generating PDF documents, users must create a PDF
        template.
      </p>
      <img src="/Assets/createPdf.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        The module for creating PDF templates in BostelCRM features a What You
        See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) interface, which allows users to create
        dynamic PDF templates. When creating a PDF template, users are required
        to select a type, which represents the module they are building the PDF
        template for. The default module options available for selection include
        Quotes, Invoices, Contacts, and Leads.
        <br />
        <br />
        To add fields into the body of the template, users need to first choose
        a module. This module can either be the same as the previously selected
        Type module, or it can be a related module. Users can select the module
        by using the first dropdown in the 'Insert Fields' row.
      </p>
      <img src="/Assets/insertField.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        Selecting a module will populate the second dropdown with all the fields
        available in that module. After choosing the desired field, its variable
        name will appear in the text field. Click on "Insert" to add the field
        to the template's body. Enabling the "Active" checkbox will allow users
        to generate PDFs using this template while disabling it will prevent
        them from doing so.
      </p>
      <h2>Loading Samples</h2>
      <img src="/Assets/loadSamples.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        The module includes various pre-designed PDF templates that can assist
        you in creating your own. To access them, simply choose the relevant
        template from the "Load Sample" dropdown list.
      </p>
      <img src="/Assets/quote.png" alt="" />

      <h2>Line Items</h2>
      <img src="/Assets/lineItem.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        If you are using a sample to generate a template for Quotes or Invoices,
        the Line Items will be presented in a table format. You have the option
        to modify the fields within this table, and add or delete columns as
        needed. However, please be aware that if you are starting a template
        from scratch, you will need to format the Line Items section as a table
        yourself.
      </p>
      <h2>Margins</h2>
      <img src="/Assets/margin.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        You have the option to specify the width of the margin for the PDF
        output at the bottom of the PDF Template Edit View.
      </p>
      <h2>Header &amp; Footer</h2>
      <img src="/Assets/header&Footer.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        In the PDF Templates Edit View, you also have the ability to define a
        Header and a Footer for your templates. The Header and Footer can be
        created by utilizing the respective text areas located beneath the Body
        text area.
      </p>
      <h2>Generate PDF</h2>
      <div class="flex">
        <img src="/Assets/printPdf.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          The functionality to "Print as PDF" or "Email PDF" enables you to
          create PDF documents for Quotes, Invoices, Contacts, and Leads.
          <br /><br />
          By clicking on the "Print as PDF" button located in the Actions tab of
          these modules' Detail View, a pop-up will appear, requesting you to
          choose a template.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="/Assets/pdfTemplate.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        The pop-up for selecting a template will display all active templates
        that have the same Type as the module of the current record. Selecting a
        template from the list will initiate the generation of a PDF document,
        which will contain data populated from the record and any related
        records. The steps for generating PDFs for Quotes and Invoices are
        outlined in their respective sections.
