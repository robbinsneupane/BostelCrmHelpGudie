      <h1>Navigation Elements</h1>
      <p>
        Efficient navigation within the CRM is essential for increased
        productivity and user adoption. BostelCRM's user interface is designed
        to be user-friendly and we will cover its various elements in this
        section. The icons, menus, and information displayed on the screen may
        vary slightly depending on the size of the browser window or device
        being used to access BostelCRM. In this guide, we will cover the three
        primary view formats you are most likely to encounter: the larger web
        browser format view, the midsized tablet view, and the smaller
        phone-sized view. Please note that these are generalizations and not an
        exhaustive list, as the view format may differ depending on the device
        being used. Once you become familiar with navigating BostelCRM on any
        type of device, you should have no trouble using it on any platform.

        <h3>Top Navigation Menu</h3>
        <img src="/Assets/desktopNav.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          A top navigation menu is a primary tool for navigating to modules and
          managing records within BostelCRM. When on the Home page, the top
          navigation menu consists of nine elements, which are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p class="navItemName">Home</p>
            <p>
              By clicking on this feature, you will be directed to the Home
              page, where you can view your recently accessed items.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="navItemName">Module List Menu</p>
            <div class="moduleList">
              <img src="/Assets/modulelist.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                This feature displays a list of various modules within
                BostelCRM, allowing you to easily navigate to them.
                <br /><br />

                To navigate to a module, hover or click on the Module List Menu
                button, which reveals a list of available modules. Clicking on a
                specific module name will direct you to the List View of that
                module.
              </p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="navItemName">Module Menu</p>
            <div class="moduleMenu">
              <img src="/Assets/module menu.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                When you access a particular module, the menu that shows up
                between the Home button and the Module List Menu reveals the
                name of the module you are currently on.
                <br /><br />
                Upon accessing a module, its name appears on the Top Navigation
                Menu, which provides a drop-down menu for available Actions,
                Recently Viewed, and Favorite records. Clicking on a record's
                name displays it while clicking on the pencil icon next to its
                name allows you to edit it directly.
              </p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="navItemName">WorkGroup Name</p>
            <p>
              This feature displays the name of your work group in the CRM,
              which you selected during account creation, typically the name of
              your business or company.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p class="navItemName">BostelCRM Logo</p></li>
          <li>
            <p class="navItemName">Quick Create</p>
            <div class="quickCreate">
              <img src="/Assets/quickCreate.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                Within BostelCRM, the Quick Create feature enables users to
                swiftly generate essential module records.
                <br /><br />
                By clicking the 'Create' icon on the top navigation menu, you
                can access the Quick Create options. This provides a list of
                frequently used modules and allows you to generate new records
                within those modules from anywhere in the system.
              </p>

            <p class="navItemName">Global Search</p>
            <div>
              <p>
                By utilizing the search feature, it is possible to conduct
                searches for data and records within BostelCRM.
              </p>
              <img src="/Assets/globalSearch.png" alt="" />
            </div>
            <p>
              The global search feature in BostelCRM allows you to explore all
              records. Clicking the magnifying glass icon on the top navigation
              menu opens a search text box, where you can enter your query and
              press return or click the search icon. Matching records are
              returned and categorized by available modules. Check the Search
              section of the user guide for more information.
            </p>

            <p class="navItemName">Notifications</p>
            <div class="notification">
              <p>
                This functionality exhibits the notifications that you have
                received.
                <br /><br />
                If there are any reminder notifications, the notification icon
                will show the count, and clicking it will reveal a list of
                reminders. By selecting an item from the expanded list, you can
                access its detail view. For additional details on Desktop
                Notifications, refer to the relevant section of the user guide.

            <p>
              The SMS communication feature will be included in an upcoming
              update.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="navItemName">User Menu</p>
            <div class="userMenu">
              <p>
                You can view and modify your profile and log out of the CRM
                using the drop-down menu next to your name, which is shown as
                the currently logged-in user. <br /><br />
                Hover or click on the user name/icon to open the user drop-down
                menu, which contains links to your profile, user guide, software
                information, and Sales Settings page for a product and PDF
                template management, and log-out option from BostelCRM. To learn
                more about these pages, see the User Profile and Sales sections
                in the user guide.

      <section class="container DsidebarMenu">
        <h2>Desktop View</h2>
        <h3>Sidebar Menu</h3>
        <div class="sidebarImg">
          <img src="/Assets/sidebar.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            The sidebar is located on the left side of the window, below the Top
            Navigation Menu bar. It displays the five most recent records you've
            viewed under the Recently Viewed heading, enabling you to swiftly
            access a recent item by clicking on its title or edit it by clicking
            the pencil icon next to its title. Up to five favorite items can
            also be viewed or edited using the same methods. The sidebar is part
            of the responsive theme and can be expanded or collapsed by clicking
            the arrow button beside it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sidebarImg">
          <img src="/Assets/sidebar 2.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            Furthermore, when you're in a module, the sidebar may show quick
            access actions based on the specific module you're using.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="container DbottomNavMenu">
        <h2>Desktop View</h2>
        <h3>Bottom Navigation Menu</h3>
        <img src="/Assets/bottomNav.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          The bottom navigation menu offers easy navigation options within the
          CRM, with quick access to frequently used modules and a reminder of
          the current module. Additionally, it includes a Back to Top arrow for
          convenient scrolling to the top of longer records.
        </p>
        <img src="/Assets/bottomNav2.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          The Add button may appear on the bottom navigation menu in certain
          modules, allowing you to create new records within that module.
        </p>
        <div class="sidebarImg">
          <img src="/Assets/salesReport.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            The sidebar is located on the left side of the window, below the Top
            Navigation Menu bar. It displays the five most recent records you've
            viewed under the Recently Viewed heading, enabling you to swiftly
            access a recent item by clicking on its title or edit it by clicking
            the pencil icon next to its title. Up to five favorite items can
            also be viewed or edited using the same methods. The sidebar is part
            of the responsive theme and can be expanded or collapsed by clicking
            the arrow button beside it.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="container TtopNavMenu">
        <h2>Tablet View</h2>
        <h3>Top Navigation Menu</h3>
        <img src="/Assets/tabletViewNav.png" alt="" />
        <div class="sidebarImg">
          <img src="/Assets/tabletView 2.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            In the Tablet view of the Top Navigation Menu, there is one more
            slight difference: the User menu button no longer exhibits the user
            name, but only shows the user icon. Nonetheless, you can still
            access the same menu by clicking on it. <br /><br />
            The tablet navigation menu resembles the desktop top navigation
            menu, with a collapsed menu button (hamburger icon) that expands to
            show the modules and allows you to create a record with the +
            button.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sidebarImg">
          <img src="/Assets/tabletView 3.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            You might observe another difference in that the module menu is now
            visible on the homepage. As a result of this change, up to three of
            your preferred items and the three most recently viewed items are
            presented in this menu, since the sidebar menu is no longer in use
            for this view. Similar to the sidebar menu, you can effortlessly
            navigate to these items or modify them using the pencil icon.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="container TbottomNavMenu">
        <h2>Tablet View</h2>
        <h3>Bottom Navigation Menu</h3>
        <img src="/Assets/tabletBottomMenu.png" alt="" />
        <img src="/Assets/tabletBottomMenu2.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          The bottom navigation menu in the tablet view remains unchanged from
          the browser view.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="container MtopNavMenu">
        <h2>Mobile View</h2>
        <h3>Top Navigation Menu</h3>
        <img src="/Assets/mobileTopNav.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          The top navigation menu in mobile view is similar to that of the
          browser and tablet views, but it is slightly reorganized to fit in a
          smaller window. If you are comfortable working with one of those
          views, you should have no trouble recognizing and navigating through
          the mobile view as well.
        </p>

        <img src="/Assets/mobileBottom.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Although the phone view bottom navigation menu may look slightly
          different, it is essentially the same as the other views. The menu has
          most of the text removed, leaving only the current module name and
          icons.
