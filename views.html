      <h1>Views</h1>
      <p>
        BostelCRM offers different views that are designed to provide you with
        relevant information throughout the record management process. The
        following sub-sections will detail the three primary views.
      </p>
      <div class="container">
        <h2>List View</h2>
        <p>
          This is the view that you are presented with when you navigate to your
          desired module.
        </p>
        <img src="/Assets/listView.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          The List View provides you with numerous actions that you can execute
          to manage records. These actions include:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            <p class="listName">Sort Records</p>
            <p>
              By clicking on the column name, you can sort the record list
              either in ascending or descending order, provided that the sorting
              feature is enabled.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="listName">View Records</p>
            <p>
              By clicking on any hyperlinked data, you will be redirected to the
              Detail View of the respective record.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="listName">Edit Records</p>
            <p>
              By clicking the pencil icon, you can access the Edit View for the
              corresponding record.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>Detailed View</h2>
        <p>
          This is the view that you are presented with when you view a record.
        </p>
        <img src="/Assets/detailedView.png" alt="" />
        <div class="flex">
          <img src="/Assets/detailedView 2.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            The List View provides you with numerous actions that you can
            execute to manage records. These actions include:
          </p>
        </div>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            <p class="listName">Edit</p>
            <p>Permits you to modify the record you are currently viewing.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="listName">Duplicate</p>
            <p>
              Enables you to replicate the record you are currently viewing.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="listName">Delete</p>
            <p>
              Allows you to remove the record you are currently viewing. If a
              record is deleted, you will be redirected to the List View.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="listName">Find Duplicate</p>
            <p>
              Allows you to initiate the find duplicates process, where you can
              utilize system functionality to identify duplicate records.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="listName">View Change Log</p>
            <p>Enables you to review changes made to audited fields.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can click on hyperlinked fields to navigate to the corresponding
          record. The Detail View in BostelCRM is organized into tabs,
          minimizing the need for scrolling, and grouping data for each module
          into the relevant tab.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>Edit View</h2>
        <p>
          This is the view that you are presented with when you edit a record.
        </p>
        <img src="/Assets/editView.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          The Edit View permits you to alter the information displayed on the
          record. This allows users to update existing data and add or remove
          information. After making changes on the Edit View, you can click
          'Save' to apply the changes, or click 'Cancel.' Either option will
          redirect you to the Detail View of the record you are editing. <br />
          <br />
          Clicking the 'View Change Log' button enables users to examine changes
          made to audited fields. This can be useful before making any intended
          changes.
