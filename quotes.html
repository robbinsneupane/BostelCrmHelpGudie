      <h1>Quotes</h1>
      <h2>Creating a Quote</h2>
      <img src="/Assets/createQuotes.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        To create a Quote, navigate to the Quotes module and click either the
        "Create Quote" button located in the Actions bar or the "Add" button at
        the bottom. The initial panel will prompt you to input information such
        as the Quote Title, related Opportunity, Stage, and Payment Terms. Note
        that the Quote Number field will be automatically calculated.
      </p>
      <img src="/Assets/address.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        In the second panel, you can identify the recipient of the Quote from
        the Contacts module. Once you have selected the appropriate Contact, the
        Billing Address associated with that Contact will be dynamically
        populated into the corresponding fields on the Quote record.
        Additionally, if the Shipping Address is identical to the Billing
        Address, clicking the "Same As Billing Address" button will
        automatically transfer the information into the Shipping Address fields
        as well.
      </p>

      <h2>Line Items with Groups</h2>
      <p>
        The third panel provides the option to add Quote Groups and Line Items.
        A Group consists of a collection of Line Items, and has its own
        corresponding Group Total. A Line Item can either be a Product Line or a
        Quick Item. To create a new Quote Group, click on the "Add Group"
        button.
      </p>
      <img src="/Assets/lineItems.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        Clicking the "Add Group" button will create a new Group, which will
        prompt you to input a Group Name and add either a Product Line or a
        Quick Item. The corresponding Group Totals will be displayed as well.
      </p>
      <img src="/Assets/lineItems2.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        To add a Product Line, select the "Add Product Line" option. This will
        enable you to quote for products from the Products module.
      </p>
      <img src="/Assets/addProductLine.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        To select a Product, you can either type in the Product or Part Number
        field and a list of results will appear, similar to any related field.
        Alternatively, you can click the arrow button located next to the Part
        Number field, which will open a pop-up window displaying a list of
        available Products for selection. <br /><br />

        After selecting a Product, the List, Sale Price, and Total fields will
        populate automatically. You can then modify the Quantity, add Discounts
        (either Percentage or Amount), and adjust the Tax percentage as
        necessary. These changes will affect the Sale Price, Total Price, and
        Group Total fields.
      </p>
      <img src="/Assets/addQuickItem.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        To add a Quick Item, click on "Add Quick Item". This option enables you
        to quote for services and other miscellaneous items. <br /><br />
        For Quick Items, you need to specify the List price, which will
        automatically populate the Sale Price field. Tax and Discounts can be
        added similarly to the Product Line. A Grand Total will be calculated
        for each Group.
      </p>
      <img src="/Assets/total.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        In addition to the Group Totals, a Grand Total will be calculated for
        all Groups combined.
        <br /><br />
        The Shipping field enables you to add the cost of shipping, while the
        Shipping Tax field allows you to add tax to this value. After you have
        compiled the Quote, click 'Save' to save it.
      </p>

      <h2>Sendign Quotations</h2>
      <div class="flex">
        <img src="/Assets/sendingQuotations.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          To generate an output for the Quote, you can select one of the
          following three buttons from the Quote Detail View. These three
          methods are:
        </p>
      </div>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Print as PDF</p>
          <p>
            Allows you to select a template and download or save a PDF of the
            Quote.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Email PDF</p>
          <p>
            Allows you to select a template then directs you to the email client
            'Compose' screen. The Quote PDF will be attached to the email and
            the email will be addressed to the related Contact of the Quote.
            This allows you to fill out the email body.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Email Quotation</p>
          <p>
            This directs you to the email client 'Compose' screen. The email
            will be addressed to the related Contact of the Quote. There will be
            no attachment and the Quote will be displayed within the body of the
            email.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Convert to Invoice</h2>
      <div class="flex">
        <img src="/Assets/sendingQuotations2.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          By clicking the 'Convert to Invoice' button on the Quote Detail View
          in the Quote module, you can convert a Quote to an Invoice. <br />
          <br />
          Users will be directed to the Edit View of an Invoice record through
          this feature. The fields will be automatically filled in based on the
          corresponding Quote and Line Items will be duplicated. To create the
          Invoice, simply click the 'Save' button. The status of the Quote will
          be changed to 'Invoiced' when it is converted to an Invoice.
