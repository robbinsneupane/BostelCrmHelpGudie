      <h1>Search</h1>
      <p>
        The act of searching plays a crucial role in CRM, enabling you to
        swiftly specify your desired information. Since numerous CRM systems
        comprise extensive data sets, it is imperative that you possess a means
        of filtering your search. The succeeding sections will detail the
        diverse search alternatives at your disposal.
      </p>
      <h2>Global Search</h2>

      <p>
        By utilizing the search bar located on the top navigation menu, you can
        employ BostelCRM's global search feature to look up active records.

      <p>
        After inputting your search term, you may either press the return key or
        select the magnifying glass/search icon. This will generate a list of
        records that meet the search criteria and classify them according to the
        modules in which they are located.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you need to limit your search by filtering out the results from
        different modules you can switch to the advanced search by clicking the
        Use Basic Search text at the top. From the advanced search page if you
        move the module names from the Enabled Modules box to the Disabled
        Modules box it will omit results from the disabled modules in your
        search results. Moving the module names from the Disabled Modules box
        back into the Enabled Modules box will enable the search results from
        those modules to be viewable once again if necessary.
      </p>
      <img src="/Assets/Images/advanceSearch2.webp" alt="" />
      <p>
        If the Enable/Disable Module boxes are not visible when you access the
        Advanced search page, you can click the arrow beside the Search button
        to display them. Conversely, if you want to hide the boxes again, you
        can click the arrow once more. <br /><br />

        To switch back to the basic search function, click on the "Use Advanced
        Search" text at the top of the page. <br /><br />

        For certain modules, you may encounter additional search options when
        creating or linking records, but these will be explained in the
        corresponding user guide sections for each module.
