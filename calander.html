      <h1>Calander</h1>
      <p>
        With the Calendar module in BostelCRM, you can efficiently manage your
        time by scheduling and viewing Meetings, Calls, and Tasks. Additionally,
        users in the same work group can share their Calendar with others,
        making it possible for them to see their upcoming activities. If a user
        is a participant or has been assigned to a task, the corresponding
        activity will be displayed in the Calendar module. To access the
        Calendar, you can either use the Module List menu located in the top
        navigation menu or click the Calendar button in the Bottom Navigation
        menu.
      </p>
      <h2>Calander Actions</h2>
      <div class="flex">
        <img src="/Assets/Images/calander1.webp" alt="" />
        <img src="/Assets/Images/calander2.webp" alt="" />
        <p>
          The Calendar actions can be accessed either from the Calendar module
          menu drop down or via the Sidebar. The following are the available
          Calendar actions:
        </p>
      </div>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Scheduling Mettings</p>
          <p>
            You can create a new Meeting record by opening a new form in the
            Edit View of the Meetings module. The created record will be
            displayed on the Calendar.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Scheduling Calls</p>
          <p>
            You can create a new Call record by opening a new form in the Edit
            View of the Call module. The created record will be displayed on the
            Calendar.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Create Task</p>
          <p>
            You can create a new Task record by opening a new form in the Edit
            View of the Tasks module. The created record will be displayed on
            the Calendar.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Today</p>
          <p>
            By clicking on this option, you will be redirected to the Week
            format of the Calendar for the current day.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition, you can create an activity directly on the Calendar by
        clicking a single block or selecting multiple blocks corresponding to
        the duration of the activity. Afterward, the Create Activity pop-up
        opens.
      </p>

      <p>This allows you to quickly schedule a meeting or log a call.</p>
      <h2>Calander Navigation</h2>
      <p>
        Upon accessing the calendar, you will be directed to the view of the
        current week with the present day being highlighted.
      </p>
      <img src="/Assets/Images/calanderNavigation.webp" alt="" />
      <p>
        At the top of the calendar page, there are buttons that let you switch
        between day, week, and month views. You can also access the shared week
        and shared month views to see the calendar of other members in your work
        group.
      </p>
      <div class="flex">
        <img src="/Assets/Images/calanderPopup.webp" alt="" />
        <img src="/Assets/Images/calanderPopup2.webp" alt="" />
        <p>
          In addition, there is a quick access calendar button that allows you
          to easily switch to different months or years. If you open this mini
          calendar, you can navigate directly to different days of the month by
          clicking on them, change months by clicking the forward and back
          arrows, or select specific months and type in the year you want to
          navigate to using another selection pop-up.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Calander Settings</h2>
      <p>
        The Settings button is located here as well, which allows you to
        customize the calendar according to your preferences.
      </p>
      <img src="/Assets/Images/canalderSetting1.webp" alt="" />
      <img src="/Assets/Images/calendarSetting2.webp" alt="" />
      <p>
        By clicking on the Settings button, you can open the calendar setting
        pop-up window, which enables you to modify the displayed hours of the
        calendar in quarter-hour increments, specify the types of events to be
        displayed, and customize the colors of the boxes, borders, and text for
        the different calendar items.
