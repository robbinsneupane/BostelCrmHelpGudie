      <h2>Creating an Invoice</h2>
      <img src="/Assets/creatingInvoice.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        The process of creating an Invoice record closely resembles that of
        creating a Quote record. To initiate the creation of an Invoice, you can
        either select 'Create Invoice' from the actions bar within the Invoices
        module, or click the 'Add' button located at the bottom. The first panel
        of the creation process allows you to specify crucial details about the
        Invoice, such as the Status and Due Date.
      </p>
      <img src="/Assets/creatingInvoice2.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        The second panel focuses on the recipient of the Invoice from the
        Contacts module. Upon selecting the appropriate Contact, the Billing
        Address is automatically retrieved and populated into the relevant
        fields of the Invoice record. In the event that the Shipping Address
        matches the Billing Address, clicking the "Same As Billing Address"
        button will efficiently duplicate the information into the relevant
        Shipping Address fields.
      </p>
      <h2>Line Items with Groups</h2>
      <p>
        Users have the ability to include Groups and Line Items in their
        Invoices via this module. The process is identical to that of creating
        Groups and Line Items for Quotes. <br /><br />
        Please refer to the Quotes section for details on how to create Groups
        and Line Items.
      </p>

      <h2>Sending Invoices</h2>
      <div class="flex">
        <img src="/Assets/sendInvoice.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          To generate output for an Invoice, you can select one of the following
          three buttons from the Invoice Detail View. These three methods are:
        </p>
      </div>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Print as PDF</p>
          <p>
            Allows you to select a template and download or save a PDF of the
            Invoice.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Email PDF</p>
          <p>
            Allows you to select a template and then directs you to the email
            client 'Compose' screen. The Invoice PDF will be attached to the
            email and the email will be addressed to the related Contact of the
            Invoice. This allows you to fill out the email body.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Email Invoice</p>
          <p>
            This directs you to the email client 'Compose' screen. The email
            will be addressed to the related Contact of the Invoice. There will
            be no attachment and the Invoice will be displayed within the body
            of the email.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
