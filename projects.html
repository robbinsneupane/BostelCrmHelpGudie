        BostelCRM utilizes Cases to document customer interactions where they
        seek assistance or guidance, typically in sales or support functions.
        Users can create, update, assign, and close Cases as they work on them,
        while tracking incoming and outgoing communication threads at each
        stage. This ensures a comprehensive record of the Case's progress is
        maintained within the CRM. Additionally, Cases can be associated with
        specific records, such as Contacts.
      </p>
      <h2>Cases Actions</h2>

        <img src="/Assets/projects2.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Users can access the Projects actions from the Projects module menu
          drop-down or via the Sidebar after clicking to view the module. The
          available Project actions are:
        </p>
      </div>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Create Project</p>
          <p>
            Clicking on the "Create" option opens a new form in the Edit View
            mode that enables users to create a new Project record.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">View Projects</p>
          <p>
            Selecting the "List Projects" option redirects users to the List
            View for the Projects module, which enables them to search and
            display a list of Project records.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Resource Calendar</p>
          <p>
            This feature enables users to search for projects based on various
            parameters such as project name, users, contacts, type, and date.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">View Projects Tasks</p>
          <p>
            The "List Project Tasks" option enables users to display a list of
            Project Tasks that are related to a parent Project.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Creating Projects</h2>
      <p>
        The Projects module allows you to create, manage, and duplicate both
        Projects and Project Tasks. For each Project, you can define multiple
        Project Tasks. To create a Project Task, you need to associate it with a
        Project. Additionally, a Project can be associated with multiple
        activities, Opportunities, and Cases.
      </p>
      <img src="/Assets/createProjects.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        Once you save the Project form, you will be redirected to the Project's
        detail page where you can view all the details related to the project.
        From this page, you can associate the project with other records such as
        Contacts and Opportunities.
      </p>

      <h2>Creating Projects Tasks</h2>
      <img src="/Assets/createProjectTasks.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        To create a new task in the Project Tasks sub-panel, you need to click
        on the "Add" button. Once on the Project Tasks page, you can fill in the
        required information for the task, including the name, task number,
        start date, finish date, percentage complete, priority level, milestone
        status, project name, and notes. You can then save the task by clicking
        the "Save" button or cancel the task creation by clicking the "Cancel"
        button. This process allows you to create and manage multiple tasks
        associated with a project in the Projects module.
      </p>

      <h2>Managing Projects &amp; Project Tasks</h2>
