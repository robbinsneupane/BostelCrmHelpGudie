      <h1>Opportunities</h1>
      <p>
        The Opportunity module in BostelCRM enables you to manage and monitor
        potential sales prospects who are qualified and likely to do business
        with your company. These prospects have demonstrated buying power and
        are in the process of making a purchase decision. You can track the
        progress of your Opportunities through the Sales Pipeline until the deal
        is either 'Closed Lost' or 'Closed Won'.
      </p>
      <h2>Opportunities Actions</h2>

        <p>
          The following actions can be accessed for Opportunities from the
          Opportunities module menu drop-down, the Sidebar, or the Sales button
          at the bottom:
        </p>
      </div>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Create Opportunities</p>
          <p>
            A new form is opened in Edit View to allow you to create a new
            record.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">View Opportunities</p>
          <p>
            This action will redirect you to the Opportunities module's List
            View where you can search and view a list of Opportunity records.
