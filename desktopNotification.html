      <h1>Desktop Notification</h1>
      <p>
        Notifications serve as reminders for your scheduled activities and
        events, ensuring that you don't miss any crucial sales call or meeting.
      </p>
      <h2>Enabling Desktop Notification</h2>
      <p>
        To enable desktop notifications, you can access the 'Advanced' tab
        within your user preferences. This will activate desktop notifications
        solely for that particular browser on that specific computer. You have
        the option of enabling desktop notifications either for that browser
        session only or always. However, if you use multiple browsers and
        computers, you will need to enable desktop notifications on each of them
        separately.
      </p>

      <p>
        After enabling desktop notifications, you will receive notifications for
        Calendar events, including
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Meetings</p>
          <p>
            Meetings you have been invited to that have popup reminders set.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Calls</p>
          <p>Calls you have been invited to that have popup reminders se</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Managing Desktop Notification</h2>
      <img src="/Assets/Images/desktopNav.webp" alt="" />
      <p>
        If there are no notifications available, the notification count will
        display as blank, indicating that there are currently no notifications
        to view.
      </p>
      <img src="/Assets/Images/desktopNotification2.webp" alt="" />
      <p>
        If you are away from your computer or fail to click on a desktop
        notification when it appears in the browser, the notifications will be
        added to the notification list. The notification list is accessible from
        the main navigation bar, which displays a count of any existing
        notifications.
      </p>
      <div class="flex">
        <p>
          To manage your notifications, click on the notification icon, which
          will reveal any existing notifications. You can click on a
          notification to access the related record, or use the small 'x' icon
          to clear individual notifications. Alternatively, you can click the
          'Clear All' button to remove all notifications at once.
