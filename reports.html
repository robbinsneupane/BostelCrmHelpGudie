        <p>
          To access the reporting module in BostelCRM, users can click on the
          'Reports' link in the navigation menu or access it through the Sales
          button menu at the bottom of the screen. This module enables users to
          generate reports on CRM data from any module and provides various
          features for quick display of important information.
          <br /><br />
          To create a report once in the Reports module on the navigation bar
          find and select 'Create Report' or use the 'Add' button at the bottom.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        You will be presented with the report Edit View. To obtain a list of
        fields to add to the report, you have to select a module from the Report
        Module drop-down.
      </p>

      <h2>Adding Fields</h2>
      <p>
        Once you have selected a Report Module, the list of fields available
        will display on the left panel. You can add fields to the 'Fields'
        section of the report by expanding the module you wish to select fields
        from and then drag and drop those fields into the field section.
      </p>
      <img src="/Assets/fields.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        Once you have added fields to a Report, there are multiple options to
        configure those fields:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Display</p>
          <p>
            The option to select true or false allows users to indicate whether
            a particular field should be visible or hidden in the report. This
            feature is useful when users want to use certain fields to perform
            functions such as sorting, grouping, or totaling, but do not want
            them to appear on the final report.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Link</p>
          <p>
            By selecting the true or false option, users can choose to turn a
            field into a hyperlink. Enabling this option will add a link to the
            field on the Detail View of the report, which can be clicked to
            navigate to the corresponding record. For instance, linking the
            Opportunity Name field will take the user to the Detail View of that
            particular opportunity.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Label</p>
          <p>
            This label will appear on the report for the corresponding
            Column/Field. Users have the option to modify the label from the
            default setting to any alphanumeric value they prefer.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Function</p>
          <p>
            There are five functions available: Count, Minimum, Maximum, Sum,
            and Average. These functions can be applied to alphanumerical
            fields, enabling users to perform various calculations. For
            instance, users can calculate the average amount of an opportunity
            or count the total number of opportunities at a particular sales
            stage.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Sort</p>
          <p>
            The Ascending or Descending option enables users to choose the
            sorting order for a field or column, either in ascending or
            descending order. This feature can be applied to all fields within
            the report.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Group</p>
          <p>
            The true or false option allows users to group data based on a
            particular field. Enabling this option allows for data grouping by
            the selected field. For example, when creating a report on
            opportunities, users can group the data based on the Sales Stage
            field.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Total</p>
          <p>
            There are three calculation options available: Count, Sum, and
            Average. These options enable users to perform total calculations on
            numerical fields, which is particularly useful for financial
            reporting. For example, users can calculate the total value of all
            opportunities at a specific sales stage using the Sum option.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Charts</h2>
      <p>
        Reports can be enhanced with the addition of charts, which offer a
        graphical representation of the data contained within the report. Visual
        aids, such as charts, can be especially helpful for certain users or in
        particular scenarios, as they can facilitate faster analysis and better
        comprehension.
      </p>
      <h2>Charts Type</h2>
      <p>
        There are six types of chart that the user can select to display Report
        data. These are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pie Chart</li>
        <li>Bar Chart</li>
        <li>Line Chart</li>
        <li>Radar Chart</li>
        <li>Stacked Chart</li>
        <li>Grouped Chart</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="/Assets/charts.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        To include a chart in a report, users can navigate to the Report Edit
        View and click on the 'Add Chart' button located below the Conditions
        section. <br /><br />
        After clicking on the 'Add Chart' button, users will have the option to
        provide the following details:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Title</p>
          <p>
            Users can provide a title for the chart, which will be displayed on
            the Detail View of the report.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Type</p>
          <p>
            This feature enables users to choose from the six types of charts
            mentioned earlier.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">X Axis</p>
          <p>Users can select the column to be used for the horizontal axis.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="listName">Y Axis</p>
          <p>Users can select the column to be used for the vertical axis.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After providing the necessary chart details, users can save the report,
        and the chart will be displayed on the Detail View of the report,
        located below the list of returned records.
