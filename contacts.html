      <h1>Contacts</h1>
      <p>
        This is the section where you can oversee and manage your profile. The A
        Contact in BostelCRM can refer to various entities, such as an
        individual who could be a client or a Lead (potential client), or an
        Opportunity (qualified prospect). It could also be a business or a
        shipping department of a supplier. Essentially, any entity that requires
        the storage of phone numbers, email addresses, addresses, or other
        information can be considered a Contact. To access the Contacts module,
        one can either navigate to the Module List menu on the top navigation
        menu or use the Contacts button on the Bottom Navigation menu.
