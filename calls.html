      <p>
        The Calls module in BostelCRM allows Users to schedule and log a record
        of inbound and outbound calls that they may be a participant of. You can
        access the Calls module from the Module List menu on the top navigation
        menu or from the Calls button on the Bottom Navigation menu.
